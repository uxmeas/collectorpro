• Real-time portfolio valuation and P&L tracking
• Advanced market intelligence with opportunity alerts
• Sub-200ms filtering performance with virtual scrolling
• Professional trading interface with Bloomberg-inspired design
• Mobile-optimized responsive design

The platform launches with three subscription tiers:
- Starter ($9.99/month): Basic analytics for up to 100 moments
- Pro ($19.99/month): Advanced analytics with unlimited moments  
- Enterprise ($49.99/month): Full feature suite with multi-portfolio support

Built using modern web technologies including Next.js 15 and TanStack Table, CollectorPRO delivers enterprise-grade performance without enterprise-grade costs.

"We're seeing strong early demand from whale collectors who need more than basic stats," added [Founder Name]. "The NBA TopShot community has been asking for professional tools, and we're excited to deliver them."
