### Phase 3: Performance Testing ⚠️
**Status:** MOSTLY COMPLETE - 1 minor issue

| Test | Status | Performance | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Concurrent Request Handling | ✅ PASS | 10/10 success | Excellent scalability |
| Response Time Consistency | ⚠️ MINOR | 42ms avg, 80ms spike | One outlier detected |

**Issue Analysis:** Response time consistency test showed one outlier (80ms vs 35ms average). This is likely due to:
- Cold start on one request
- Background processes
- Network variability
- **Impact:** Minimal - still well within acceptable range

| Large Payload Handling | ✅ PASS | Handles large requests |

**Issue Analysis:** Malformed JSON handling needs improvement. Current behavior:
- Accepts malformed JSON without proper error response
- **Impact:** Low - edge case that doesn't affect normal operation
- **Fix Required:** Add proper JSON validation

### Phase 5: Browser Compatibility Testing ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE - All tests passed

| Test | Status | Notes |
